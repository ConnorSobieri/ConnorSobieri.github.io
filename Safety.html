      Safety
    </header>
    <p> Due to the powerful adaptations of this species, one wouldn't be dumb enough to get near one of these monkeys, unless that person is a milennial looking for a cute social media photo. However, they are very aggressive towards humans as they see humans as their prey. Therefore, it is important to look for the signs of whether a monkey is a normal monkey, or a vampire monkey. Remember these three signs <ol>
      <li> Razor Sharp Teeth </li>
      <li> Blood Dripping Off Fur </li>
      <li> Weapons </li> </ol><div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:75%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/hFFiZ1AzsNyla" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed"></iframe></div><p> or just remember RBW for short. In the very dire situation that one gets near a Vampire Monkey, whether they are not paying attention, or just being a stupid milennial, they can be reasoned with. If you make slow movements to drop your wallet on the ground in front of the monkey, there is a decent chance that they may let you go. In conclusion, the best way to stay safe is awareness as remember the useless acronym, RBW, and stay away from this species as that is the most likely way you will get out of an encounter alive, or at least with your wallet. </p>
