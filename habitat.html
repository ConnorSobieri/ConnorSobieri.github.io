    <p> Vampire Monkeys' original habitat were the rivers of the inner Amazon jungle. However, after the piranhas moved into these parts, the monkeys had decided to migrate up north to Connecticut <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRqyVzvG8PzuVFut4_68lDmjNccMSH_H2gBl_zR_9kF6bIeiTlPaQ"> where they had found their new target, Roman Sobieri. Their motives behind finding this target is entirely unknown as scientists have barely been able to get near a Vampire Monkey nonetheless study it. Specifically, the habitat of the Vampire Monkey is in Greenwich, Connecticut, as they are said to live in the pond of Binney Park.<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRx8ijHAt2AJvhpqzgWsxRNvT4a75xqAT-oqIBAmk1ZAGBP6qKr"> There is also strong evidence to believe that they are collaborating with the snapping turtles in order to terrorize the area and catch more prey. This area has a lot of squirrels, deer, and annoying siblings and neighbors for the monkeys to feast upon. However, their welcome to the area has became completely sour as the Greenwich Police Department had drained the pond in order to try to kick them out. However, they just camoflauged to the ground and just chilled out until water was returned to the area along with the snapping turtles that were conserved.</p>
